\section{Abstract}
Natural history specimens are widely used across ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation. 
We assume these collections are representative of natural populations, but recent work has suggested that many collections have disproportionately more male than female specimens. 
Here, we investigate sex ratios in over five million amphibian and reptile specimen records from global natural history collections. 
We found a slight bias towards males in amphibians (39\% females) and reptiles (47\% females), but this varied among orders and families. Body size, sexual size dimorphism and year of collection had little effect. 
Strikingly however, over 95\% of herpetology specimen records had no sex data associated with them at all, even from recent collections. 
This lack of sex data may be harming herpetological research in myriad ways.

\section{Introduction}\label{main}

Natural history collections across the world contain 2-4 billion specimens that offer a unique insight into the biosphere’s past, present and potential future\cite{meineke2018biological}. 
Applications of collections are expanding beyond taxonomy and systematics into ecological and environmental research, furthering our knowledge of biological processes and interactions\cite{mclean2015natural}. 
Museum collections also represent a baseline with whic,h to compare current data, allowing the effects of anthropogenic activities to be studied\cite{lister2011natural,meineke2018biological,modica2020surrounded,buckingham2021using}. 
With such a broad range of applications, it is crucial that collections are representative of natural biodiversity. However, this is rarely the case. 
Sampling and recording effort is not standardised across museums and collections, with opportunistic sampling leading to unrepresentative data\cite{pyke2010biological,daru2018widespread,cooper2019sex}.. 
Spatial, temporal and even aesthetic biases are regularly encountered in collections data\cite{pyke2010biological} which has implications for any analyses using these data without accounting for them\cite{daru2018widespread}. 

One potential bias in animal collections is sex bias. 
Sex influences many aspects of a species’ ecology including taxonomy, genetics, and morphology; thus, any bias towards one sex may adversely influence the outcome of collections-based research\cite{cooper2019sex}. 
In mammal and bird collections, there are slightly higher proportions of males than females\cite{machin2008,cooper2019sex,gower2019}, despite sex ratios in the wild being close to 50:50 \cite{karlin1986theoretical,szekely2014sex}. 
This is particularly striking in groups where males have  ornamentation or more colourful plumage, or are more aesthetically impressive\cite{pyke2010biological,cooper2019sex}, suggesting that a major component of this bias is artificial and driven by a preference for certain specimens. 

Here we investigate whether there is a sex bias in herpetology (amphibian and non-avian reptile) collections using 5,937,255 specimen records from 341 natural history museums worldwide\cite{gbif-amphibians,gbif-reptiles}. 
Various characteristics of amphibians and reptiles suggest their sex ratios in collections will be more skewed than those for mammals and birds. 
They have diverse sex determination systems\cite{miura2017sex,katona2021evolutionary}, including temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles, meaning wild sex ratios may be skewed towards females or males depending on the ambient temperature\cite{while2018patterns}. 
Some reptiles are parthenogenetic, for example 13 species within the whiptail genus \textit{Aspidoscelis}\cite{barley2019complex}, so all individuals are female. 
Strong SSD, in which one sex is substantially larger than another, may impact collections as larger specimens are collected at a higher rate, both unintentionally and intentionally\cite{cooper2019sex,gower2019,thompson2020avian}.
Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) occurs across amphibians and reptiles, but it varies in direction and magnitude (Alex Slavenko’s paper). 
In most amphibians, females are larger than males\cite{pincheira2021multiple}, but there is more variation within reptiles. 
In crocodilians, males are larger than females, often extremely so, but in turtles and snakes SSD is generally female skewed (Alex Slavenko’s paper). 
All of these factors may influence sex ratios in collections. 
We also investigate patterns in what specimens records have sex information associated with them. 

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data collection and cleaning}

\subsubsection{Specimen records data}
We downloaded all herpetology specimen records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF\cite{gbif-amphibians,gbif-reptiles}), selecting all preserved specimen records. 
These specimens were collected between 1800 and 2021, and came from 341 natural history collections across six continents. 
Prior to analyses we excluded all juveniles, young and embryos from the dataset as these are harder to sex. 
We standardised species names using Amphibian Species of the World\cite{frost2021} and The Reptile Database\cite{uetz2021} and removed extinct species. 
We split types into name bearing (Holotype, Syntype, Lectotype, Neotype) and non-name bearing (Paratype, Paralectotype, Paraneotype, Allotype, Topotype, Cotype) types\cite{schuchert1897type}. 
Where the records did not specify the kind of type we define these as ambiguous types. 
Although biological sex is a spectrum\cite{sciam2017}, we focus on specimens identified as females and males for simplicity and because the majority of the records use this coding. 
We standardized sex to either female, male or non-sexed. 
The final dataset contained 5,937,255 specimens (2,753,451 amphibians and 3,183,804 reptiles), 277,073 (82,577 amphibians and 194,496 reptiles) of which were sexed. Note that throughout we refer to 'specimens' and 'sexed specimens' as a shorthand, but we are technically dealing with 'specimen records' and 'specimen records with sex information'. 

\subsubsection{Size and sexual size dimorphism data}
We used snout-vent-length (SVL; mm) as our measure of body size, except in Testudines, where we used carapace length (CL; mm) as SVL measurements were not available (NHM Data Portal - to add). 
For each species, we recorded maximum body size for the species and for females and males separately, then calculated sexual size dimorphism by dividing maximum male body size by maximum female body size. 
We also recorded which sex was larger (Females, Males, Neither). 
Note that the sample size for these variables is lower because sex disaggregated body size data are rare (see Table A1). 

The final cleaned data are available on the NHM Data Portal (add data citation when deposited). 

\subsection{Analyses}

We performed all analyses in R version 4.1.0\cite{R}. 
Reproducible scripts are available on GitHub at https://github.com/nhcooper123/sex-bias-herps [\cite{coopercode2022} we will add a zenodo link on acceptance].

\subsubsection{Overall percentage of female, male, sexed and unsexed specimens and name-bearing types}
We first calculated the overall percentage of sexed and unsexed specimen records, and within sexed specimens, the proportion of female and male specimen records, for amphibians and reptiles, across orders, and for name-bearing types separately. 

\subsubsection{Correlates of sex bias}
To investigate correlates of sex bias, our analyses use the proportions of female and male specimens within a species as the response variable. 
Most species were represented by only a few specimens (Figure A1), with large skews towards either females or males at low numbers (Figure A2). 
To reduce problems this is likely to cause when fitting models, we used only species with 10 or more specimens in our models. Ideally we would use a higher cut-off, but the median number of sexed specimens for each species was eight so this would have removed a substantial amount of the data. 

We fitted all models using generalised linear models (GLM) with quasibinomial errors, with the proportion of female specimens (success) and the proportion of male specimens (failure) for each species as the response variable (i.e. a binomial response where the number of females and the number of males for each species were jointly modelled). 
For models where the explanatory variable was the year of collection, our response variable was female specimens and the proportion of male specimens for each species for each year from 1880-2020. 
The number of specimen records and species in each model vary and are shown in Table A1.

We used quasibinomial rather than binomial errors due to overdispersion (all models have deviance/residual degrees of freedom far greater than two), and assessed the significance of model terms using Type II sums of squares. 
We used standard model checks for GLMs (Q-Q plot, histogram of residuals, residuals vs. linear predictors, response vs. fitted values) to assess model fit. 

We tested whether the proportion of female and male specimens within each species varied with (i) order (excluding Gymnophiona and Rhynchocephalia as these orders each had only one species with 10 or more sexed specimens), (ii) year of collection, (iii) maximum body size (overall, female and male), and (iv) sexual size dimorphism (male size divided by female size, larger sex; these analyses excluded parthenogenetic species which do not have any males). 

\subsubsection{Correlates of sex recording}
The majority of herpetology specimen records did not include sex information (see Results). 
This may reflect specimens that have never been sexed, or specimens of known sex where sex has not been added to specimen records. 
To investigate how unsexed specimens are distributed across amphibians and reptiles, we fitted the GLMs in the same way as described above but using the proportion of sexed specimens (success) and the proportion of unsexed specimens (failure) within each species with 10 or more specimens as the response variable. 
We tested whether the proportion of sexed and unsexed specimens within each species varied with (i) order (excluding Rhynchocephalia as this order has only one species), (ii) year of collection, (iii) maximum body size (overall, female and male), and (iv) sexual size dimorphism (male size divided by female size, larger sex; excluding parthenogenetic species).

\section{Results}

\subsection{Overall proportions of female, male, sexed and unsexed specimen and name-bearing type records}
Of the 5,937,255 specimen records (2,753,451 amphibians and 3,183,804 reptiles) in our dataset, 1.2\% of amphibian specimens were female, 1.8\% were male, and 97\% were not sexed (Table A2; Figure A3). 
For reptiles, the number of non-sexed individuals was 93.9\%, with 2.8\% female and 3.3\% male specimens. 
These percentages varied across orders and families, but in all orders and families (except Nasikabatrachidae within Anura, and Chikilidae within Gymnophiona) the majority of specimens were unsexed (Tables A3-A4; Figures A4-A8).

Of the 14,260 name bearing type records (5,062 amphibians and 9,198 reptiles) in our dataset, 6.3\% of amphibian name-bearing types were female, 8.3\% were male, and 85.4\% were not sexed (Table A2; Figure A3). 
For reptiles, the number of non-sexed name-bearing types was 85.8\%, with 6\% female and 8.2\% male name-bearing types. 
These percentages also varied across orders, but in all orders the majority of name-bearing types were unsexed (Figure A4).

If we consider only sexed specimens, 39\% of amphibian and 47\% of reptile specimens, and 43\% of amphibian and 43\% of reptile name-bearing types, were female (Table A2; Figure A3). 
The percentages of females varied across orders; though only Caudata and Testudines have more than 50\% female specimens (Figure A4), and no orders have more than 50\% female name-bearing types.

\subsection{Correlates of sex bias and sex recording}

\subsubsection{Orders}
Across all seven orders, only Gymnophiona (52.6\%) and Testudines had greater than 50\% females (54.3\%) on average within a species. 
The proportion of female and male specimens within each species varied strongly with order in both amphibians and reptiles (amphibians: $F_{1,1141}$ = 162.28, p $<$ 0.001; reptiles: $F_{2,2160}$ = 41.27, p $<$ 0.001). 
In amphibians, the proportion of females within species was highest in Gymnophiona, followed by Caudata and Anura (Figure \ref{fig-females}; Table \ref{table-percents}), and in reptiles the proportion of females within species was highest in Testudines, followed by Squamata, Crocodylia and Rhynchocephalia (Figure \ref{fig-females}; Table \ref{table-percents}). 

The proportion of sexed and unsexed specimens within each species varied significantly with order in both amphibians and reptiles (amphibians: $F_{2,4815}$ = 24.68, p $<$ 0.001; reptiles: $F_{2,6724}$ = 177.43, p $<$ 0.001). 
In amphibians, the proportion of sexed specimens within species was highest in Anura, followed by Caudata and Gymnophiona (Figure \ref{fig-sexed}; Table \ref{table-percents}), and in reptiles the proportion of sexed specimens within species was highest in Testudines, followed by Crocodylia, Rhynchocephalia and Squamata (Figure \ref{fig-sexed}; Table \ref{table-percents}). 

\subsubsection{Year of collection}
The proportion of female and male specimens within each species varied significantly with year of collection for amphibians ($F_{1,1298}$ =  11.22, p $<$ 0.001) and reptiles ($F_{1,2814}$ = 7.769, p = 0.005) with the proportion of females collected decreasing through time (Figure \ref{fig-time}). 
The proportion of sexed and unsexed specimens within each species also varied strongly with year of collection for amphibians ($F_{1,34318}$ = 1254, p $<$ 0.001) and reptiles ($F_{1,44053}$ = 1454, p $<$ 0.001), with the proportion of sexed specimens increasing through time (Figure \ref{fig-time}), though this effect was weak.

\subsubsection{Body size and SSD}

For amphibians, the proportion of female and male specimens within each species did not significantly vary with maximum body size ($F_{1,227}$ =  2.545, p = 0.112; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}A), maximum male body size ($F_{1,179}$ =  0.6393, p = 0.425; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}B), maximum female body size ($F_{1,179}$ =  1.554, p = 0.214; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}C), sexual size dimorphism ($F_{1,173}$ =  1.725, p = 0.191; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}D), or with which sex was larger ($F_{2,192}$ =  1.645, p = 0.196; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}E).   

For reptiles, the proportion of female and male specimens within each species did not significantly vary with maximum body size ($F_{1,303}$ =  0.455, p = 0.501; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}A), maximum female body size  ($F_{1,195}$ =  0.027, p = 0.869; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}C), or sexual size dimorphism ($F_{1,160}$ =  3.905, p = 0.050; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}D). However there was a significant difference with maximum male body size  ($F_{1,173}$ =  6.715, p = 0.010; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}B), and depending on which sex was larger ($F_{2,226}$ =  14.53, p = 0.019; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}E), with species where males are larger having a fewer female specimens than those where females or neither were larger (Figure \ref{fig-ssd-female}E).

For amphibians, the proportion of sexed and unsexed specimens within each species did not significantly vary with maximum body size ($F_{1,230}$ =  1.611, p = 0.206; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-sex}A), maximum female body size ($F_{1,182}$ =  1.478, p = 0.226; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-sex}B), maximum male body size ($F_{1,182}$ =  1.653, p = 0.200; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-sex}C), sexual size dimorphism ($F_{1,176}$ =  0.264, p = 0.608; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-sex}D), or with which sex was larger ($F_{2,195}$ =  1.197, p = 0.304; Figure \ref{fig-ssd-sex}E).   

For reptiles, the proportion of sexed and unsexed specimens within each species did not significantly vary with maximum female body size  ($F_{1,196}$ =  1.215, p = 0.272; Figure 5B), maximum male body size ($F_{1,175}$ =  2.183, p = 0.141; Figure 5C), sexual size dimorphism ($F_{1,161}$ =  0.034, p = 0.853; Figure 5D), or which sex was larger ($F_{2,227}$ =  3.094, p = 0.050; Figure 5E). There was a marginally significant difference with maximum body size ($F_{1,306}$ =  4.793, p = 0.029; Figure 5A).
